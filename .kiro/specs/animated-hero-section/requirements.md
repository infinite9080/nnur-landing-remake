# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing hero section with a sophisticated SVG animation system that includes floating 3D isometric shapes, animated paths, particle effects, and smooth CSS animations. The goal is to create an engaging, modern hero section that captures user attention while maintaining excellent performance and responsiveness across all devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see an engaging animated hero section when I first land on the page, so that I feel impressed by the modern design and want to explore further.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the hero section SHALL display a full-screen animated SVG with floating elements
2. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the animation SHALL show 3D isometric cubes, floating dots, and animated paths
3. WHEN the animation plays THEN all elements SHALL move smoothly without causing performance issues
4. WHEN the page is viewed THEN the animation SHALL loop continuously without interruption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the hero animation to work perfectly on my device, so that I have the same engaging experience as desktop users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the animation SHALL scale appropriately and maintain smooth performance
2. WHEN the screen size is below 768px THEN the floating cubes SHALL scale to 70% of original size
3. WHEN the screen size is below 480px THEN the floating cubes SHALL scale to 50% of original size
4. WHEN on mobile THEN the animation SHALL not cause scrolling issues or performance degradation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the animation code to be modular and maintainable, so that I can easily modify or extend the animations in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the animation SHALL be contained in a separate reusable component
2. WHEN organizing the code THEN CSS animations SHALL be in a dedicated stylesheet
3. WHEN structuring the SVG THEN elements SHALL be grouped logically (isometric shapes, flying elements, etc.)
4. WHEN writing the code THEN it SHALL follow Next.js best practices and TypeScript standards

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the hero section to have smooth text animations alongside the SVG, so that the entire section feels cohesive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the hero title SHALL animate in with a smooth entrance effect
2. WHEN the title animation completes THEN the description text SHALL animate in with a slight delay
3. WHEN the text animations complete THEN the call-to-action buttons SHALL animate in
4. WHEN all animations are complete THEN the text SHALL remain static while the SVG continues animating

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the animations to be optimized and not impact page load speed, so that I have a fast browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the initial render SHALL not be blocked by animation code
2. WHEN animations are running THEN they SHALL use CSS transforms and opacity for optimal performance
3. WHEN implementing animations THEN they SHALL avoid layout thrashing and repaints
4. WHEN the component mounts THEN it SHALL use efficient animation techniques (CSS over JavaScript where possible)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an accessibility-conscious user, I want the animations to respect my motion preferences, so that I can use the site comfortably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has reduced motion preferences THEN the animations SHALL be significantly reduced or disabled
2. WHEN implementing animations THEN they SHALL not cause seizures or vestibular disorders
3. WHEN animations are present THEN they SHALL not interfere with screen readers or keyboard navigation
4. WHEN motion is reduced THEN the visual design SHALL still look appealing with static elements
